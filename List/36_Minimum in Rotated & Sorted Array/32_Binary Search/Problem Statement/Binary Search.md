## **Binary Search**
Given a sorted array of N integers and you need to find if Key (K) exists in the array or not, write an efficient code to do this.


__Note__: Try to do it by implementing Binary Search both iteratively and recursively

#### **Sample Input**
    N = 4, arr[] = { 1, 3, 4, 7 }, K = 3

#### **Sample Output**
    true

#### **Sample Explanation**
    Using Binary Search we find that key 3 exists in the array.

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(logN), where N is the length of the array
#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), constant space solution


#### **Constraints**
    1<= N <= 10^6
    1<= arr[i] <= 10^6
