## **Reverse a linked list**

Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing the links between nodes.


#### **Sample Input**
	list = 1->2->3->4->NULL

#### **Sample Output**
	list = 4->3->2->1->NULL

#### **Sample Explanation**
On reversing the linked list by changing the link between the nodes, the linked list is transformed as shown in the sample output


#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N), where N is the number elements in the linked list.


#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), i.e. , constant space complexity.

#### **Constraints**
	A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. The task is to implement both the implementations.
