## **Print all subsequences of a string**
Given a string, we have to find out all subsequences of it.

__Note__: A String is a subsequence of a given String, that is generated by deleting some character of a given string without changing its order.

#### **Sample Input**
    abc

#### **Sample Output**
    a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc
#### **Sample Explanation**
    Generate all subsequence of string "abc"

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(2^N*l), where N is length of string to find subsequences and l is length of binary string.
#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(N), Auxiliary space

#### **Constraints**
	1 <= N <= 10
