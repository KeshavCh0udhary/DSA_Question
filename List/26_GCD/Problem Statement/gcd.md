## **GCD**
Given two integer N and M. Calculate the gcd of N and M.

#### **Sample Input**
	input: N = 10, M = 6

#### **Sample Output**
	Output: 2

#### **Sample Explanation**
2 is the biggest factor that divides both 10 and 6.

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(log(MAX(N,M)))

#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), i.e., constant space complexity.

#### **Constraints**
	1 <= N,M <= 1000000000
