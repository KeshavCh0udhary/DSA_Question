## **Palindrome Linked List**

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

__NOTE__ : A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.

#### **Sample Input**
	list = 1->2->2->1

#### **Sample Output**
	Given linked list is a palindrome

#### **Sample Explanation**
The linked list given in the sample test case, is the same read whether forwards or backwards. Therefore, it can be deemed as a palindrome.


#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N), where N is the number of elements in the linked list.


#### **Expected Space Complexity**

__O__(N), Auxiliary space
 

#### **Constraints**
	This can be checked both iteratively and recursively. The task is to implement both the implementations.
