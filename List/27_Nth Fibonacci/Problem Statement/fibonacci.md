## **Nth Fibonacci**
Given a positive integer N. Find the Nth fibonacci number.

__NOTE__ : In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The beginning of the sequence is thus
`[0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...]`

#### **Sample Input**
	input: N = 5

#### **Sample Output**
	A: 3

#### **Sample Explanation**
Fibonacci series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ....
Hence 5th fibonacci is: 3

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N)

#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(N), Auxillary space complexity.

#### **Constraints**
	1 <= N <= 100000
