## Inspiration

Coding interviews have never been more popular. With the boom of the internet, not only we got easier access to information, but also, the requirement for high - quality developers, reached an all time high. As the demand for high - quality developers increased, coding interviews became tougher and tougher. The questions around Data Structures and Algorithms have been a nemesis for developers all over. There seems to be a problem of too - many, when one looks for resources on the internet around these, and most times the resources are not structured. This is the problem that this repo intends to solve, by providing the minimum number of question that can get you up and ready for your next coding interview.

After a thorough research and studying data gathered from various sources, we gathered questions, which are not just important from an interview perspective, but also help in building a solid understanding of the underlying topics, we came up with this curated set of questions. We have tried to make this repo a one-stop solution for your DSA - Preparation needs, and therefore, for each question we have provided the problem statement, a well-curated thorough editorial, and ideal solutions in some of the more popular languages. Currently, you will find solutions in Java, C++, and Python, but slowly, we will be adding ideal solutions in other languages as well.

The Editorials are thorough, and we have made it in the simplest language possible, because as developers, we understand, **SIMPLE IS BEAUTIFUL**. The editorials cover all aspects of a particular problem, from the explanation of the question, to the explanation of different approaches, and also the Time and Space Complexity of the proposed solution. In the ideal solutions, we have tried to follow all the best practices according to the industry standards, and are made in such a way, that you not only understand the approach, but also the implementation, in case it is required.

We have ordered the questions in a way, such that the difficulty level is  enhanced at each step, which keeps you motivated and challenged at the very same time.
